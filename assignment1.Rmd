The data set birthweight.txt contains the birthweights of 188 newborn babies. We are interested in finding the underlying (population) mean μ of birthweights.

a) Check normality of the data. Compute a point estimate for μ. Derive, assuming normality (irrespective of your conclusion about normality od the data), a bounded 90% confidence interval for μ.

```{r}
birth = read.table("birthweight.txt",header=TRUE)
birth$birthweight
mean(birth$birthweight)

shapiro.test(birth$birthweight)
```


b) An expert claims that the mean birthweight is bigger than 2800, verify this claim by using a t-test. What is the outcome of the test if you take α = 0.1? And other values of α?
c) In the R-output of the test from b), also a confidence interval is given, but why is it different from the confidence interval found in a) and why is it one-sided?
